# Sample Package

I'm a very bad student and I just want to pass the exam... this package does nothing but it works!!!

## Installation

```R
# first install the R package "devtools" if not installed
devtools::install_github('unimi-dse/15f07018')
```

## Usage

Load the package

```R
require(sample)
```

The only function of the package is `hello()` and prints _"Hello, world!"_

```R
hello()
```
